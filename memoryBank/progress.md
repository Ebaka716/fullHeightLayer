# Progress

*   **What Works:**
    *   Basic Next.js app setup with TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn.
    *   Direct header/main layout in `ExamplePage`.
    *   `FullHeightLayer` component rendering below header.
    *   Layer visibility toggled from main header button.
    *   Layer uses smooth slide transition.
    *   Layer width is resizable via dragging left edge (min: 450px, max: 75% viewport).
    *   Layer initializes at correct minimum width (no snapping).
    *   Layer has internal menu button triggering a slide-in menu view.
    *   Layer header buttons (menu, close) styled with colors/icons/reduced padding.
    *   Layer menu buttons have icons (`lucide-react`).
    *   Layer content area has a bottom-aligned, full-width, taller input field with internal Send icon.
    *   Main content area displays a static table.
    *   Toggle buttons show active state.
    *   Browser tab title set.
    *   Vercel deployment succeeds.
*   **To Build:**
    *   Input field Send action functionality.
    *   Layer menu button actions (New Search, History, Settings).
    *   Actual dynamic content for the layer instead of just the input.
    *   More robust error handling/edge cases.
*   **Status:** Core layout and layer mechanics implemented and styled. Basic content placeholders added. Deployment is stable.
*   **Known Issues:**
    *   None currently active.
    *   ~~Recent Git/Tooling issues~~ (Resolved).
    *   ~~Vercel build failing due to unescaped entity~~ (Resolved by escaping ').
    *   ~~Layer loaded initially smaller than min-width~~ (Resolved by fixing initial state).
*   **Decision Log:**
    *   [Date] Initial implementation using custom components and state.
    *   [Date] Attempted refactor to shadcn Sidebar, reverted.
    *   [Date] Implemented manual resize logic.
    *   [Date] Implemented internal menu takeover view.
    *   [Date] Removed PageLayout, refactored layout, fixed build, set tab title.
    *   [Today] Styled layer header/menu buttons, added input+icon, added table view, refined resize logic (min/max), fixed build/layout bugs.
